== Creating the first risk analysis

After clicking on
`Create a risk analysis`, 

image:RiskAnalysis_1_800.png[Create a risk analysis]

the following pop-up appears:

image:RiskAnalysis_2_800.png[Create a risk analysis]

1.  Select `List of risks models`
2.  There are at least two choices. Select `Modelling NC3`. 
Modelling NC3 is the default template made available by the MONARC editor. 
It provides sufficient knowledge bases to start a risk analysis. 
This option should be used by default to start a new risk analysis. 
3.  Select your preferred language for this new analysis. (FR/EN/DE/NL)
4.  Give a name for your risk analysis, for example, __My analysis__.
5.  Optional field, which allows you to describe your analysis in more detail.

<<<

== Description of the main view

image:RiskAnalysis_3_800.png[Main view]

1.  Risk Analyses panel: Create and select a risk analysis. Once the
analysis is selected, the left column can be retracted to optimize the
horizontal space by clicking on the icon image:HideRiskAnalysesPanel.png[Hide Risk Analyses panel icon,pdfwidth=3%,width=3%].
2.  Navigation panel: User administration and account management.
3.  Access to steps of the method by clicking on numbers `1` to `4`.
4.  Contextual working areas of analysis.

== Simplified risk analysis

=== Risk identification (default modelling)

It is necessary to use the assets of the library and place them in the analysis. If the risk analysis does not contain any assets, follow the instructions below,
otherwise go to the next chapter. 

By default, MONARC suggests a structure where primary assets (business assets) are placed at the root of the analysis, with supporting assets organized beneath them.
In order to simplify this step, two groups of assets have been created:

* `Front-Office`: This asset group identifies common risks associated with a 'Human Resources' department from the user's perspective, including risks related to office spaces, computers, applications, and physical and environmental factors.
* `Back-Office`: This asset group identifies cross-functional risks within the organization, specifically those related to IT and general organizational functions.

image:Modelling.png[Modelling]

Click on the `+` or the `-` to expand or wrap all categories of the
library.

1.  In the category `Primary assets`, click on `Department` and then, by
holding down the left mouse button, move the asset to the analysis area
just above (Drag and Drop).
2.  In the category `Model Structure` find the assets `Front Office` and
`Back Office` and then, by holding down the left mouse button, move the
asset to the asset Department, which is now in the analysis area.

image:DefaultRiskModelling_1_800.png[Default Risk Modelling]

1.  The risk analysis now offers a model for __Department__.
2.  The _Front Office_ now offers a default identification of the risks
on the users’ side.
3.  The _Back Office_ now offers a default identification of the risks,
for IT and organization.
4.  The total number of risks in this model is 84 (in this case).

IMPORTANT: The Identified risks are those commonly encountered
and considered significant by default, though they are not intended to be exhaustive.

=== Edit impacts and consequences

The goal is to define the impacts and consequences on primary assets that may result from a risk occurring within the model. 
In this analysis, the primary asset is the __Department__.

image:EditImpacts_1_800.png[Edit impacts]

1.  Click on the primary asset `Department`.
2.  Click on the icon image:Menu.png[Menu,pdfwidth=4%,width=4%]to display the context menu of the asset.
3.  Click on `Edit impacts`.

The pop-up below appears.

image:EditImpacts_2_800.png[Edit Impacts]

1.  Consultation of impact scales is done through the menu at the top right of the screen.

TIP: _By leaving the pointer unmoved over the numbers,
the meaning of this number appears after one second._

When one of the criteria *C* (confidentiality), *I* (integrity) or *A*
(availability) is allocated, there is a need to ask: what are the
consequences on the company, and more particularly on its ROLFP, i.e.
its **R**eputation, its **O**peration, its **L**egal, its **F**inances
or the impact on the **P**erson (in the sense of personal data).

In the case of the above figure, the `3` (out of 5) impact on
confidentiality, is explained by the maximum value ROLFP regarding
confidentiality. Example, `3` is the consequence for the person in case
of disclosure of his personal file.

=== Risk assessment

image:RiskAssessmentTable_1_800.png[Risk assessment]

1.  Click on a secondary asset, for example `Building`.
2.  `CIA Impact`: It has been assigned to the _Department_ and is inherited
by default, so no further action is required.
3.  `Threat`: _Theft or destruction of media, documents or equipment_ is
a physical threat that expresses fear of being robbed or destroyed
materials.
4.  `Probability (Prob.)`: This is an estimate of the probability on a
scale of 1 to 4 that the threat occurs. Take, for example, the case of a
very large company where this threat is above average, so **3**.
5.  `Vulnerability`: __The principle of least privilege is not
applied__. The security principles focus on determining who has access rights and whether those rights align with the responsibilities of the individuals involved.
6.  `Existing controls`: Describe, in a factual manner, the security
controls in place regarding this vulnerability or, more broadly, the
risk in question. Take, for example, a second unfavourable case, for
example a hospital where the whole building is like a public area.
7.  `Qualification (Qualif.)`: Concerning the measure in place
(point 6 above), the vulnerability qualification is therefore maximum of
*5* out of 5.
8.  `Current Risk` : All the parameters for calculating the risk are
present, the current risk is therefore calculated based on the CIA
values, which are directly dependent on the threat.

TIP: _By leaving the pointer on most fields, a tooltip appears after
1 second._

=== Risk treatment

The risk treatment consists of proposing one of the 4 types of
treatment, knowing that most of the time the treatment is to reduce the
risk by allocating a control, or to accept a weak risk. To access the risk treatment table, click
on `Not treated` in the __Treatment column__.

image:RiskTreatmentTable_1_800.png[Risk treatment]

1.  Create one or many recommendations.
2.  Define the treatment type (according to ISO / IEC 27005).
3.  Estimate the risk-reducing value in order to define the residual risk.
4.  Save the treatment (or click ‘Next’ in case you do more than one risk treatment at once).





=== Risk treatment plan management

image:PlanTreatment.png[Plan risk treatment]

In that case, the risk treatment plan only consists of one risk, but
once all risks are treated, all risks and information risk
recommendations will be in the treatment plan.

1.  The call of the pop-up is done by clicking on the 3rd step of the
method (Evaluation and treatment of risks) and choosing the link `Risk treatment plan management`.
2.  You can order the recommendation positions by holding down the left mouse
button on the icon image:MoveButton.png[Move button,pdfwidth=4%,width=4%] and moving it.
3.  Reset the positions in importance order (Imp.)
4.  Edit recommendation

A final report of the risk analysis can be generated by clicking on the 3rd
step of the method and choosing the link `Deliverable: final report`.

NOTE: Deliverables are only relevant when the MONARC method has been
fully processed and all information has been entered.
