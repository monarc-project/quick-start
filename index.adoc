== Introduction

=== Purpose

The purpose of this document is to help get started quickly with MONARC.

== Creating the first risk analysis

After clicking on
`Create a risk analysis`, the following pop-up appear

image:NewRiskAnalysis.png[Create a risk analysis]

1.  Select `CASES model`
2.  There are at least two choices. Select `Modelling CASES`, this is
the default template. It provides sufficient knowledge bases to start an
analysis.
3.  `Show inherent operational risks`. This option does not matter right
now.
4.  Select your preferred language for this new analysis. (FR/EN/DE/NL)
5.  Give your analysis a name, for example __My analysis__.
6.  Optional field, which allows you to describe your analysis with more
details.

<<<

== Description of the main view

image:Main.png[Main view]

1.  Risk Analyses panel: Create and select a risk analysis. Once the
analysis is selected, the dashboard can be retracted to optimize the
horizontal space by clicking on icon image:HideRiskAnalysesPanel.png[Hide Risk Analyses panel icon,pdfwidth=3%,width=3%].
2.  Navigation panel, users administration and account management.
3.  Access to steps of the method by clicking on numbers 1 to 4.
4.  Contextual working areas of analysis.

== Simplified risk analysis

=== Risk identification (default modeling)

It is necessary to use the
assets of the library and place them in the analysis. If the risk
analysis does not contain any assets, follow the instructions below,
otherwise go to the next chapter. MONARC proposes by default a structure
where primary assets (Business) must be placed on the root of the
analysis and supporting assets below. In order to simplify this step,
two groups of assets have been created:

* `Front-Office`: This asset group provides the identification of the
common risks found on the user’s side for a “Human Resources” department
(for example, risks related to the office, computers, applications,
physical & environmental risks…).
* `Back-Office`: These assets group provide the identification of
transversal risks of the organization related to the IT and to
organizations in general.

image:Modelling.png[Modelling]

Click on the `+` or the `-` to expand or wrap all categories of the
library.

1.  In the category `Primary assets`, click on `Department` and then, by
holding down the left mouse button, move the asset to the analysis area
just above (Drag and Drop).
2.  In the category `Model Structure` find the assets `Front Office` and
`Back Office` and then, by holding down the left mouse button, move the
asset on the asset Department, which is now in the analysis area.

image:Model.png[Model]

1.  The risk analysis now offers a model for __Department__.
2.  The _Front Office_ now offers a default identification of the risks
on the users’ side.
3.  The _Back Office_ now offers a default identification of the risks,
for IT and organization.
4.  The total number of risks in this model is 84 (in this case).

IMPORTANT: Identified risks by default are the risks commonly encountered
and supposed to be significant, they do not claim to be exhaustive.

=== Edit impacts and consequences

The aim is to define impacts and consequences for primary assets that can result
from an occurrence of a
risk from the model. In the case of this analysis, the primary asset is
__Department__.

image:EditImpacts.png[Edit impacts]

1.  Click on the primary asset `Department`.
2.  Click on icon image:Menu.png[Menu,pdfwidth=4%,width=4%]to display the
context menu of the asset.
3.  Click on `Edit impacts`.

The pop-up below appears.

image:Impacts.png[Impacts]

1.  Consultation of impact scales is done through the menu at the top
right of the screen.

TIP: _By leaving the pointer unmoved over the numbers,
the meaning of this number appears after one second._

When one of the criteria *C* (confidentiality), *I* (integrity) or *A*
(availability) is allocated, there is a need to ask : what are the
consequences on the company, and more particularly on its ROLFP, i.e.
its **R**eputation, its **O**peration, its **L**egal, its **F**inances
or the impact on the **P**erson (in the sense of personal data).

In the case of the above figure, the `3` (out of 5) impact on
confidentiality, is explained by the maximum value ROLFP regarding
confidentiality. Example, `3` is the consequence for the person in case
of disclosure of his personal file.

=== Risk assessment

image:RiskAssessment.png[Risk assessment]

1.  Click on a secondary asset, for example `Building`.
2.  `CIA Impact`: It has been assigned to the _Department_ is inherited
by default and are no longer required.
3.  `Threat`: _Theft or destruction of media, documents or equipment_ is
a physical threat that expresses fear of being robbed or destroyed
materials.
4.  `probability (Prob.)` : This is an estimate of the probability on a
scale of 1 to 4 that the threat occurs. Take, for example, the case of a
very large company where this threat is above average, so **3**.
5.  `Vulnerability`: __The principle of least privilege is not
applied__. The security principles searched are to know who has access
rights and whether they related to the duties of the people involved.
6.  `Existing controls`: Describe, in a factual manner, the security
controls in place regarding this vulnerability or, more broadly, the
risk in question. Take, for example, a second unfavorable case, for
example a hospital where the whole building is like a public area.
7.  `Qualification (Qualif.)` : In relation to the measure in place
(point 6 above), the vulnerability qualification is therefore maximum
*5* out of 5.
8.  `Current Risk` : All the parameters for calculating the risk are
present, the current risk is therefore calculated based on the CIA
values, which are directly dependent on the threat.

TIP: _By leaving the pointer on most fields, a tooltip appears after
1 second._

=== Risk treatment

The risk treatment consists in proposing one of the 4 types of
treatment, knowing that most of the time the treatment is to reduce the
risk by allocating a control, or to accept a weak risk. To access click
on `Not treated` in __Treatment column__.

image:RiskTreatment.png[Risk treatment]

1.  Create one or many recommendations.
2.  Define the treatment type (according to ISO / IEC 27005).
3.  Estimate the risk-reducing value in order to define the residual
risk.
4.  Save the treatment.

=== Risk treatment plan management

image:PlanTreatment.png[Plan risk treatment]

In that case, the risk treatment plan only consists in one risk, but
once all risks are treated, all risks and information risk
recommendations will be in the treatment plan.

1.  The call of the pop-up is done by clicking on the 3rd step of the
method and `Risk treatment plan management`.
2.  Order the recommendation positions holding down the left mouse
button on icon image:MoveButton.png[Move button,pdfwidth=4%,width=4%] and move it.
3.  Reset the positions in importance order (Imp.)
4.  Edit recommendation

A final report of risk analysis can be generated by clicking on the 3rd
step of the method and `Deliverable: final report`.

NOTE: Deliverables are only relevant when the MONARC method has been
fully processed and all information has been entered.
